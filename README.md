> DSH Skills Manager is a community-maintained DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin, not an official DeepSeek AI product.

This README describes **1.1.13**. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [release notes](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-skills-manager/releases/latest).

## Features


Bring skills from your computer and projects into DSH without switching between Agent folders.

- **Manage in one place**: browse collapsible source groups, search, read, and toggle skills.
- **Global and project skills**: the project tab follows the current session, with project copies taking priority over global copies.
- **Reuse existing skills**: supports Codex, Claude Code, Copilot, and other agents without modifying their source files when toggled.
- **Create and import**: create a skill or import ZIP archives, folders, and `SKILL.md` files into global DSH.
- **Skill repositories**: discover public GitHub skills, install without overwriting local files, review updates and restore backups.
- **Recover deleted skills**: DSH skills go to Trash first, so accidental deletions can be restored.

- **Source tracking and updates**: distinguish local and repository skills, preview file changes, protect local edits, and confirm backup, update or rollback.

*Screenshots show the pre-release 0.1.54 local build used to prepare 1.0.0. The final version adds refresh animation and progress feedback. Screenshots show only the feature panels, with real filenames and project directories cropped out of the background, and use lossless WebP.*

## Installation

Requires a working DeepSeek Harness installation. The commands below use the `web` profile; replace it with yours if needed.

Supported plugin installation sources are the npm registry, a locally built `.tgz` package, and GitHub. GitHub and npm both include a ready-to-run `lib`. After changing source, run the build before committing.

### Ask an agent to install it

Send this to an agent that can use your local terminal:

```text
Install the latest @michengai/dsh-skills-manager into my DSH web profile using the official npm registry. Confirm installation and explain how to reload DSH.
```

### Install manually

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-skills-manager@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

Restart DSH, refresh the page, and open **Settings → Skills**. To update, select **Check for updates** or run the installation command again.

- Plugin `1.1.14` accepts DeepSeek Harness `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <1.0.0` and is verified against `0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.5-rc.1`, `0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.5-rc.3`, `0.1.7-rc.1`, `0.1.7-rc.2`, `0.2.0-rc.1`, `0.2.0-rc.2`, `0.2.1-alpha.1`, `0.2.1-alpha.2`.

## Usage

| What you want to do | How |
| --- | --- |
| Find a skill | Choose Global or Project, expand a source group, or use search and filters. |
| Read its contents | Select **View details** for the skill body and source information. |
| Enable or disable | Toggle the skill switch. This affects DSH without editing source files. |
| Add a skill | Select **Create skill** or **Import into global DSH**. |
| Install from a repository | Open **Repositories → Add repository**, enter a public GitHub URL, scan, click **Install**, choose **DSH skills** or **Shared Agent**, check its actual path, and confirm. |
| Uninstall a repository skill | Click the red **Uninstall** button and confirm. The installed folder and local edits move to **Trash**, and **Install** becomes available again. |
| Update repository skills | Select **Refresh & check updates**, then **Review update** to inspect changes and confirm backup and update. |
| Roll back an update | Select **Restore previous version** for a skill with a backup, preview and confirm. |
| Recover a deletion | Open **Trash** and restore. For project skills, return to a session in the original project first. |

- **Current project only**: Git repositories use the nearest Git root. Other folders use the current session working directory; no `git init` required.
- **Independent copies**: disabling a project copy allows another enabled copy to take over, and the panel identifies the active source. Disable all copies to turn the skill off completely.
- **File management**: DSH skills can move to Trash from the general manager. Repository-installed copies in DSH or Shared Agent can also be uninstalled from **Repositories**. Codex, Claude and other external skills remain read-only. Creation and file import still save to global DSH.
- **Restore**: retired repository provenance belongs to the specific Trash entry and is reactivated only by an explicit restore, including the destination and update/rollback history. A different same-name skill does not inherit repository management. Uninstalling a Shared Agent copy affects every agent using that directory.

### Repository boundaries

- The header **Check for updates** updates the plugin itself. Repository **Refresh & check updates** checks skill contents without installing or replacing them; it shows animation, counts and the current repository.
- Repository installation writes only to global DSH or Shared Agent (`~/.agents/skills`, overridable with `DSH_AGENTS_HOME`). The chooser shows the configured path and disables unsafe paths; a missing directory is created only after confirmation. Codex, Claude and other agent directories cannot be selected. Arbitrary paths, project destinations and plugin-managed caches are not writable. Missing destinations in legacy records default to DSH; updates and rollback follow the recorded destination. Public GitHub repositories are supported; private credentials and automatic updates are not. Removing a subscription keeps installed skills.
- Archives are limited to 32 MiB, including when filtering by subdirectory. Failed scans preserve the previous catalog; corrupt caches require refresh.
- Local edits require explicit confirmation before replacement. Historical backups are not automatically cleaned and consume additional disk space.

## Supported Agent directories

`~` means your home directory; `<project>` is the current session project root. These are default paths; configured DSH directory variables take precedence.

| Source | Global directory | Project directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSH | `~/.dsh/skills` | `<project>/.dsh/skills` |
| Shared Agent | `~/.agents/skills` | `<project>/.agents/skills` |
| CC Switch | `~/.cc-switch/skills` | — |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills` | `<project>/.codex/skills` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills` | `<project>/.claude/skills` |
| Gemini | `~/.gemini/skills` | `<project>/.gemini/skills` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills` | `<project>/.opencode/skills` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills` | `<project>/.cursor/skills` |
| Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills` | `<project>/.github/skills` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills`<br>`~/.windsurf/skills` | `<project>/.windsurf/skills` |
| Trae | `~/.trae/skills` | `<project>/.trae/skills` |
| Trae CN | `~/.trae-cn/skills` | `<project>/.trae-cn/skills` |
| OpenClaw / Clawdbot | `~/.openclaw/skills`<br>`~/.clawdbot/skills` | — |
| Roo | `~/.roo/skills` | `<project>/.roo/skills` |
| CodeBuddy | `~/.codebuddy/skills` | `<project>/.codebuddy/skills` |
| WorkBuddy | `~/.workbuddy/skills` | `<project>/.workbuddy/skills` |
| Qoder | `~/.qoder/skills` | `<project>/.qoder/skills` |
| Qoder CN CLI | `~/.qoder-cn/skills` | — |
| Qoder CN | `~/.lingma/skills` | `<project>/.lingma/skills` |
| Project Skills | — | `<project>/skills` |

The generic `<project>/skills` directory is labeled **Project Skills** and also supports OpenClaw workspace skills. Qoder CN CLI project skills use `<project>/.qoder/skills` and appear as Qoder. Qoder CN IDE uses the Lingma directories. Missing external source directories are not shown.

## Feedback and contributions

[Open an issue](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-skills-manager/issues) for bugs or suggestions. Include your DSH and plugin versions, reproduction steps, and a full screenshot for UI issues.

Source code lives in `src` and uses strict TypeScript while retaining the existing plugin architecture. Run `npm run typecheck` for type checks, `npm run build` to generate runtime files, and `npm run verify` for the full regression and package checks. GitHub and npm both include a ready-to-run `lib`. After changing source, run the build before committing. Packing still checks types and builds the JavaScript files required by the npm package. CI runs full verification on Node.js 22.19.0 and 24, and code changes also trigger the supported-host compatibility matrix. Contributions are welcome.

To test a source checkout, install dependencies using the pinned pnpm version, run `npm run verify`, then run `npm pack`. Install the resulting `.tgz` with `dsh plugin --profile web add <package.tgz>`, restart DSH and refresh the page. Do not use `--ignore-scripts` when packing: it skips the build hook.
